# AC7_Autosplit

This repository contains a basic autosplitter for the game 'Ace Combat 7'.
The autosplitter currently supports automatic tracking of ingame time as well as splits on mission fadeout.
An other feature already implemented is the ability to do subsplits for the destruction missions in the main campaign (Long Day and Fleet Destruction) on their respective Ace and S-Rank score requirements.

For usage in a full game run just start your timing normally (on difficulty select) with your split button, thereafter you should no longer need to worry about the splits.

For individual level usage just start the mission as you normally would - the autosplitter will automatically detect the mission start and begin to start the timing.

This repository also contains sample layout and split files for reference.
